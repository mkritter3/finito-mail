# ü§ñ Claude CLI - Self-Learning Documentation System

**üö® CRITICAL: Claude must ONLY read from `live_docs/` directory for current information.**

## üß≠ Live Documentation Navigation

**Claude: Read ONLY these verified, up-to-date files:**

### üìÇ Current Working Documentation
- **[live_docs/CLAUDE.md](./live_docs/CLAUDE.md)** - Smart router and command reference
- **[live_docs/TOOLS_MCP.md](./live_docs/TOOLS_MCP.md)** - Verified MCP tool commands  
- **[live_docs/TOOLS_ELECTRON.md](./live_docs/TOOLS_ELECTRON.md)** - Verified Electron workflows
- **[live_docs/TOOLS_WEB.md](./live_docs/TOOLS_WEB.md)** - Verified web development tools
- **[live_docs/TOOLS_MOBILE.md](./live_docs/TOOLS_MOBILE.md)** - Verified mobile development tools

### üß† Persistent Learning
- **[CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md](./CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md)** - Your accumulated knowledge and experience

### üìö Project Documentation Structure
- **[docs/README.md](./docs/README.md)** - Main documentation hub
- **[docs/troubleshooting/](./docs/troubleshooting/)** - Common issues and FAQ
- **[docs/architecture/decisions/](./docs/architecture/decisions/)** - Architecture Decision Records

## üîÑ Self-Learning Process

### 1. Documentation Sources (Priority Order)
1. **live_docs/** - ONLY verified, working commands (read this)
2. **CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md** - Your persistent memory (always update)
3. **Context7** - Latest framework documentation (use for current info)
4. **Zen tools** - Multi-AI collaboration (use for strategy)

### 2. Memory Update Protocol
**Claude: ALWAYS update CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md when you:**
- ‚úÖ Discover commands that work reliably
- ‚ùå Identify commands that fail or timeout
- üîß Find solutions to problems
- üìà Learn better workflows
- üêõ Solve debugging challenges

### 3. Repository Organization
**Current Structure:**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ live_docs/          # ‚Üê READ ONLY FROM HERE (auto-generated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md  # ‚Üê YOUR MEMORY (always update)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src_docs/           # Source documentation (human-edited)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/            # Old/deprecated files (ignore unless asked)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/            # Verification and generation tools
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/  # Auto-update CI/CD
```

## üö® Critical Rules for Claude

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO:
1. **Read from `live_docs/` only** - This contains verified, working information
2. **Update `CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md`** - Add your learnings after every task
3. **Use Context7 first** - Get latest documentation before coding
4. **Use Zen tools** - Avoid direct MCP/Gemini commands that timeout
5. **Follow verification status** - Commands marked ‚úÖ VERIFIED work reliably

### ‚ùå NEVER DO:
1. **Don't read from `archive/`** - Contains outdated, potentially confusing information
2. **Don't use `claude /mcp`** - Known to timeout and cause issues
3. **Don't use direct `gemini "command"`** - Use Zen chat instead
4. **Don't ignore verification status** - Commands marked ‚ùå FAILED will not work

## üîß Quick Command Reference

### Container Management (100% Reliable)
```bash
dev                    # Start development environment
dev --status          # Check status  
dev --rebuild          # Rebuild if needed
dev test-gui          # Test GUI forwarding
```

### Working Development Patterns
```bash
# Multi-AI collaboration (VERIFIED)
claude "Use zen chat with gemini-2.5-pro to analyze [problem]. use context7"

# Get documentation (VERIFIED) 
claude "Use context7 to get [framework] documentation focused on [topic]"

# Testing (VERIFIED)
e2e-test -u http://localhost:3000
autonomous-debug --url http://localhost:3000
```

## üéØ Self-Optimization System

This documentation system:
- **Auto-verifies commands** before including them
- **Removes failing commands** from live documentation  
- **Archives outdated information** to prevent confusion
- **Updates based on real usage** and verification results
- **Maintains consistency** across all documentation files

## üß† Your Learning Cycle

1. **Read Task** ‚Üí Check `live_docs/` for current methods
2. **Execute Work** ‚Üí Use verified commands and workflows
3. **Learn from Results** ‚Üí Note what worked/failed
4. **Update Memory** ‚Üí Add findings to `CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md`
5. **Stay Current** ‚Üí System auto-updates documentation based on verification

## üìù Documentation Maintenance

### Checking Documentation Integrity
```bash
# Run the documentation integrity checker
node scripts/check-docs-integrity.js

# This will:
# - Find all markdown files in /docs
# - Check for orphaned files (not linked in any README)
# - Check for broken links
# - Exit with error if issues found
```

### Adding New Documentation
1. **Choose the right location** based on content type:
   - `/docs/getting-started/` - Setup and quickstart guides
   - `/docs/architecture/` - System design and technical details
   - `/docs/features/` - Feature-specific documentation
   - `/docs/troubleshooting/` - Common issues and solutions
   - `/docs/architecture/decisions/` - ADRs for major decisions

2. **Update the section's README.md** to include your new file
3. **Run integrity check** to ensure no orphaned files
4. **Follow the format** of existing documentation

### Creating Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
```bash
# 1. Copy the template
cp docs/architecture/decisions/adr-template.md docs/architecture/decisions/XXXX-your-decision.md

# 2. Fill in all sections:
# - Context (the problem)
# - Decision (what we're doing)  
# - Consequences (trade-offs)
# - Alternatives (what else we considered)

# 3. Update the ADR index
# Edit docs/architecture/decisions/README.md to add your ADR
```

### Documentation Best Practices
- **Keep it current** - Update docs when code changes
- **Be specific** - Include code examples and commands
- **Think of the reader** - What would a new developer need to know?
- **Use visuals** - Diagrams help explain complex concepts
- **Test your docs** - Follow your own instructions

---

**Claude: This system ensures you always have accurate, working information and never get confused by outdated commands. Always read from `live_docs/` and update your knowledge after completing tasks. When adding new documentation, always run the integrity checker and update relevant index files.**
