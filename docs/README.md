## üìù Documentation Standards

### File Naming
- Use UPPERCASE for primary documentation files (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Use lowercase with hyphens for supplementary files (e.g., `environment-setup.md`)
- Keep file names descriptive and searchable

### Content Structure
1. Start with a clear title and overview
2. Include a table of contents for longer documents
3. Use code examples and diagrams where helpful
4. Cross-reference related documentation
5. Keep technical accuracy as the top priority

### Maintenance
- Documentation is treated as **immutable** once finalized
- Updates create new versions rather than modifying existing docs
- All changes must be tracked and justified
- Architecture decisions are permanent records

## üîÑ Documentation Workflow

1. **Planning**: New features start with documentation
2. **Implementation**: Code follows the documented design
3. **Review**: Documentation updated based on implementation learnings
4. **Maintenance**: Regular audits ensure accuracy

## ü§ù Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:
1. Place it in the appropriate category
2. Update this index file
3. Cross-reference related documents
4. Follow the naming conventions
5. Ensure technical accuracy
6. **Run the integrity checker**: `node scripts/check-docs-integrity.js`

### Documentation Integrity
We use automated checks to ensure documentation quality:
- **No orphaned files** - All docs must be linked from an index
- **No broken links** - All references must point to existing files
- **CI/CD integration** - Automated checks on every PR

To check documentation integrity locally:
```bash
node scripts/check-docs-integrity.js
```
