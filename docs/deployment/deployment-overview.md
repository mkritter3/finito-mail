## Railway Deployment Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables

Add these variables in Railway's "Variables" tab:

| Variable Name           | Description                                                                                                                              | Example / How to get                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`              | Sets the environment to production. Next.js and other libraries use this to enable optimizations.                                          | `production`                                                                                                     |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`          | The canonical URL of your deployed application. **Crucial for OAuth redirects.**                                                         | `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app` (or your custom domain)                                                   |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`       | A secret key used to sign and encrypt JWTs and session cookies.                                                                          | Generate a strong, random string. You can use `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal.                      |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`      | Your Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Client ID for the **production** application.                                                                | Get this from your Google Cloud Console credentials page.                                                        |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`  | Your Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Client Secret for the **production** application.                                                            | Get this from your Google Cloud Console credentials page.                                                        |
| `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`  | The refresh token for the authorized Google account used to send emails on behalf of the application.                                    | This must be obtained through an OAuth consent flow for the specific Google account you intend to use.           |
| `AUTHORIZED_EMAIL`      | The email address that is authorized to access and use the application.                                                                  | `your-authorized-email@gmail.com`                                                                                |
| `LOG_LEVEL`             | Sets the logging level for production monitoring.                                                                                        | `info` (recommended for production)                                                                               |

### 2. Production Deployment Checklist

**‚òê Step 1: Configure Google Cloud OAuth for Production**
1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Select your project.
3. Create a **new** "OAuth 2.0 Client ID". Do not reuse your development credentials.
4. Set the "Application type" to "Web application".
5. Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", add your Railway app's URL:
   - `https://<your-project-name>.up.railway.app`
6. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add your NextAuth callback URL:
   - `https://<your-project-name>.up.railway.app/api/auth/callback/google`
7. Save the credentials and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

**‚òê Step 2: Set Up Your Railway Project**
1. Log in to your Railway account.
2. Create a new project and link it to your application's GitHub repository.
3. In your project dashboard, go to the "Variables" tab.
4. Add all the environment variables from the table above. Use the "Secret" type for sensitive values like `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and Google credentials.

**‚òê Step 3: Deploy**
1. Commit the optimized `railway.toml` and the new `src/app/api/health/route.ts` file to your repository.
2. Push the changes to your main branch (or whichever branch you've configured Railway to deploy from).
3. Railway will automatically trigger a new deployment. The build process will:
   - Install dependencies across the monorepo
   - Build only the web app and its dependencies using Turbo
   - Start the Next.js server with proper port binding
   - Begin health checks within 20 seconds
4. Monitor the build and deploy logs in the Railway dashboard for any errors.

**‚òê Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification**
1. Once the deployment is live, access your Railway URL.
2. Test the Google login flow. The first login might be slow as the container starts up.
3. Check the application logs in Railway for any runtime errors after you log in and interact with the app.
4. Verify that the server actions (e.g., fetching emails) are working correctly.

### 3. Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: OAuth tokens are stored in httpOnly cookies for security
- **Rate Limiting**: Circuit breaker pattern implemented for Gmail API protection
- **Input Validation**: All Server Actions use Zod for input validation
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Pino for production monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper error boundaries

### 4. Monitoring & Debugging

- **Health Check**: `/api/health` endpoint for Railway monitoring
- **Structured Logs**: View logs in Railway dashboard for debugging
- **Error Tracking**: All errors are logged with context and stack traces
- **Performance Metrics**: Circuit breaker metrics available for monitoring

### 5. Scaling Considerations

- **Concurrency Control**: Gmail API requests are limited to 3 concurrent requests
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests per second to respect Gmail API limits
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic protection against API failures
- **Caching**: Ready for Redis integration for session storage

### 6. Environment-Specific Configuration

**Development**:
- Pretty-printed logs for debugging
- Detailed error messages
- Hot reload enabled

**Production**:
- Structured JSON logs for aggregation
- Sanitized error messages
- Optimized builds
- Performance monitoring enabled

### 7. Alternative: Docker Deployment

If you need more control over the deployment environment, a `Dockerfile` is available in the repository. To use it:

1. Enable Next.js standalone output in `next.config.mjs`
2. Remove `builder` and `buildCommand` from `railway.toml`
3. Railway will automatically detect and use the Dockerfile

### 8. Custom Domain Setup

Once deployed, you can add a custom domain in Railway:

1. Go to your project's "Settings" tab
2. Click "Custom Domains"
3. Add your domain and configure DNS records
4. Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` to use your custom domain

### 9. Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:
- **OAuth Redirect Mismatch**: Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your Railway URL
- **API Failures**: Check circuit breaker logs and Gmail API quotas
- **Build Failures**: Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- **Runtime Errors**: Check Railway logs for detailed error messages

**Health Check Failures**:
- Verify the health endpoint is accessible
- Check server startup logs
- Ensure proper environment variables are set

**Performance Issues**:
- Monitor circuit breaker metrics
- Check Gmail API rate limits
- Review structured logs for bottlenecks
