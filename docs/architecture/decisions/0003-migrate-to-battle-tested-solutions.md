# ADR-0003: Migrate to Battle-tested Solutions

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Author**: Development Team

## Context

During the development of Finito Mail, we've built several custom solutions for problems that already have mature, battle-tested solutions in the ecosystem. This includes:

- Custom webhook processing and retry logic
- Custom rate limiting implementation  
- Custom WebSocket/SSE management
- Manual Gmail API retry logic
- Custom job processing for rules engine

This approach has led to:
- Increased maintenance burden
- More bugs to fix
- Reinventing solutions that already exist
- Time spent on infrastructure instead of features
- Reliability issues in production

## Decision

We will systematically migrate from custom implementations to battle-tested solutions:

1. **Inngest** for serverless job processing (replacing custom webhooks)
2. **Supabase Realtime** for WebSocket management (replacing Redis Pub/Sub)
3. **p-retry** for resilient API calls (replacing custom retry logic)
4. **bottleneck** for rate limiting (replacing custom implementation)
5. **@google-cloud/local-auth** for OAuth flows (where applicable)

This migration will happen in phases to minimize disruption while improving reliability.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Better reliability (these tools are used by thousands)
- More time to focus on core product features
- Better documentation and community support
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Improved production stability

### Negative
- Initial migration effort required
- Learning curve for new tools
- Some loss of customization flexibility
- Potential for slightly higher costs
- Dependency on external services

### Neutral
- Need to monitor deprecations and updates
- Different debugging approaches
- Team training on new tools

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Continue with Custom Solutions
Keep building and maintaining our own:
- High maintenance cost
- Continuous bug fixes
- Less reliable than proven solutions
- Diverts focus from product

### Option 2: Full Platform Migration
Move everything to a single platform (e.g., all Supabase):
- Too much lock-in
- May not be best-in-class for each need
- Expensive migration

### Option 3: Gradual Feature-by-Feature Migration
Current approach - migrate based on pain points:
- Balanced risk
- Learn from each migration
- Maintain service availability

## Implementation Notes

Phase 1 (Immediate):
- Keep Redis Pub/Sub (working well)
- Add connection pooling
- Implement monitoring

Phase 2 (Q1 2025):
- Migrate to Inngest for job processing
- Add bottleneck for rate limiting
- Implement p-retry for API calls

Phase 3 (Q2 2025):
- Migrate to Supabase Realtime
- Evaluate Socket.io for specific needs
- Consolidate infrastructure

Each migration should:
1. Run in parallel with existing solution
2. Use feature flags for gradual rollout
3. Monitor metrics during transition
4. Have rollback plan ready
