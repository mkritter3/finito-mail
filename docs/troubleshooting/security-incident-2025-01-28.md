# Security Incident - Exposed Production Secrets (2025-01-28)

## Summary
Production secrets were accidentally exposed in git history through environment configuration files. All compromised secrets have been rotated and git history has been cleaned.

## Timeline
- **Discovery**: 2025-01-28 - Found `RAILWAY_ENV_VARS_STAGING.md` file containing production secrets
- **Initial Response**: Immediately began secret rotation process
- **Resolution**: All secrets rotated, git history cleaned, staging environment verified working

## Affected Secrets
1. **Supabase API Keys**
   - JWT Secret (master authentication key)
   - Anon/Service Role keys (replaced with new publishable/secret keys)
   
2. **Google OAuth**
   - Client Secret (rotated)
   
3. **Redis**
   - Password (rotated in Railway)
   
4. **Railway Deploy Hook** (regenerated)

## Remediation Steps Taken

### 1. Secret Rotation
- ✅ Rotated Supabase JWT secret (invalidated all user sessions)
- ✅ Generated new Supabase API keys (publishable/secret format)
- ✅ Rotated Google OAuth client secret
- ✅ Updated Redis password in Railway
- ✅ Regenerated Railway deploy hook

### 2. Code Updates
- ✅ Updated codebase to use new Supabase environment variable names:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` → `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`
- ✅ Updated all Supabase client initialization code
- ✅ Updated `.env.example` with new variable names

### 3. Git History Cleaning
- ✅ Used `git-filter-repo` to remove all files containing secrets
- ✅ Removed files:
  - `RAILWAY_ENV_VARS_STAGING.md`
  - `docs/features/email-sync/supabase-oauth-setup.md`
  - `.env.production`
  - `.env.production.example`
- ✅ Force pushed clean history to GitHub
- ✅ Verified no secrets remain in history

### 4. Verification
- ✅ Created staging health check script
- ✅ Verified all staging endpoints working
- ✅ Confirmed old Supabase keys disabled

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate
1. **Updated `.gitignore`** to prevent environment files from being committed
2. **Removed all sensitive files** from repository history
3. **Documented new secret names** in `.env.example`

### Recommended
1. **Use secret scanning** - Enable GitHub secret scanning
2. **Pre-commit hooks** - Add hooks to prevent secrets in commits
3. **Environment management** - Use secure secret management tools
4. **Regular audits** - Periodically scan for exposed secrets
5. **Access control** - Limit who can access production secrets

## Lessons Learned
1. Never commit environment files, even temporarily
2. Always use `.gitignore` for sensitive files before creating them
3. Rotate all secrets immediately upon discovery
4. Clean git history to prevent future exposure
5. Document new secret formats clearly

## Production Migration Plan
1. Clone staging environment in Railway
2. Update production-specific environment variables
3. Test thoroughly before switching traffic
4. Monitor for any authentication issues

## Status
- **Staging**: ✅ Fully remediated and verified working
- **Production**: ⏳ Pending (will clone from secured staging)
