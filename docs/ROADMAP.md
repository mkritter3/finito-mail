# Finito Mail Implementation Roadmap

**Last Updated: 2025-01-23** | **Status: 75% Complete** | **Production Timeline: 2.5 Weeks**

This document provides a realistic roadmap for implementing Finito Mail's hybrid architecture. Based on expert review and comprehensive codebase analysis, we've updated the timeline to reflect current implementation status and remaining work.

## üö® Current Status & Production Path

### Implementation Status (January 2025)

**Feature Completeness: ~75%**

#### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- OAuth2 authentication with Google (‚úÖ 100% tests passing!)
- Full email operations (list, read, sync)
- **Email sending functionality (compose, reply, forward)** 
- Database schema and migrations (9 migration files)
- Folder/label management
- Basic search functionality  
- Bulk actions (mark read, delete, archive)
- Advanced rules engine with security controls
- Hybrid storage architecture (PostgreSQL + IndexedDB)
- Gmail API integration with retry logic
- Basic UI components (email list, viewer, compose dialog)
- Monorepo structure with Turborepo

#### ‚ùå Production Blockers (2 Remaining)
1. ~~**Failing OAuth Tests**~~ - ‚úÖ FIXED! All 61 tests passing (100% pass rate)
2. **No Performance Monitoring** - Cannot guarantee <100ms SLA without APM
3. **No Real-Time Sync** - Missing webhook endpoint and client updates

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt
- No snooze functionality (API exists, not implemented)
- No smart inbox AI features
- Limited to Gmail (no Outlook/IMAP support)
- No attachment handling implementation
- Missing advanced search (Gmail syntax)

### üöÄ 3-Week Production Readiness Plan

#### Week 1: Critical Fixes (Days 1-5)
**Goal: Fix authentication and establish monitoring baseline**

```typescript
// Priority 0: Fix OAuth Tests
- [x] Debug test environment configuration ‚úÖ
- [x] Verify OAuth callback URLs and secrets ‚úÖ
- [x] Fix mock authentication helpers ‚úÖ 
- [x] Ensure cross-browser compatibility ‚úÖ
- [x] Add integration tests for token refresh ‚úÖ
// ‚úÖ COMPLETED: 100% pass rate achieved!

// Priority 1: Implement Monitoring
- [ ] Integrate APM tool (Sentry/DataDog/New Relic)
- [ ] Add structured logging with request IDs
- [ ] Create /api/health endpoint
- [ ] Implement performance metrics collection
- [ ] Configure error alerting
```

#### Week 2: Real-Time Updates (Days 6-10)
**Goal: Implement push notifications or polling fallback**

```typescript
// Webhook Infrastructure
- [ ] Create /api/gmail/webhook endpoint
- [ ] Implement webhook signature verification
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud Pub/Sub
- [ ] Configure Gmail watch API

// Client Updates  
- [ ] Choose update mechanism:
  - Option A: Server-Sent Events (recommended)
  - Option B: WebSocket implementation
  - Option C: 60-second polling (fallback)
- [ ] Update UI for real-time changes
- [ ] Test end-to-end sync latency
```

#### Week 3: Production Hardening (Days 11-15)
**Goal: Final testing and deployment preparation**

```typescript
// Performance & Security
- [ ] Load test with 100+ concurrent users
- [ ] Verify <100ms response times
- [ ] Test with 50k+ email mailboxes
- [ ] Security audit (OWASP checklist)
- [ ] Memory leak detection

// Deployment

- [ ] Monitoring dashboard configuration
- [ ] Deployment scripts and CI/CD
- [ ] Beta user onboarding plan
- [ ] Go/no-go decision checklist
```

## Architecture Summary

Finito Mail uses a **hybrid architecture** matching Inbox Zero's approach:
- **PostgreSQL** for email metadata (headers, subjects, senders)
- **Client-side IndexedDB** for email bodies and performance
- **Redis** for time-based features (snooze) and caching
- **Minimal server** for auth, webhooks, and API proxying

### Key Differentiators
1. **Modifier Queue Pattern** - Instant UI updates with background sync
2. **Progressive Sync** - Emails available in seconds, not minutes
3. **Hybrid Search** - Local results instantly, server results for completeness
4. **Push Notifications** - Real-time updates without polling

## MVP Definition

**12-Week Goal**: A rock-solid, performant, single-device email client with core productivity features.

**Explicitly Deferred**: Cross-device sync, AI features, and advanced optimizations (moved to post-MVP roadmap).

## Original 12-Week Implementation Plan (Updated with Current Status)

### üìÖ Phase 1: Foundation & Sync (Weeks 1-5) 

#### Weeks 1-2: Infrastructure & Gmail API + Security

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Critical Code Patterns

**Always Use These Patterns:**

1. **Retry with Backoff:**
```typescript
await retryWithBackoff(async () => {
  return await gmail.users.messages.get({ 
    userId: 'me', 
    id: messageId 
  });
});
```

2. **Idempotent Operations:**
```typescript
interface ModifierOperation {
  id: string; // Unique UUID per operation
  type: 'archive' | 'delete' | 'snooze';
  emailId: string;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

3. **Sync Checkpoints:**
```typescript
interface SyncCheckpoint {
  userId: string;
  folderId: string;
  lastHistoryId: string;
  processedCount: number;
  totalCount: number;
  lastProcessedDate: Date;
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|-------|
| Sync complexity | 2 weeks allocated, checkpoint system | Week 3-4 |
| Modifier queue reliability | 2 weeks allocated, idempotency | Week 6-7 |
| Push notification setup | Fallback polling, 2 weeks allocated | Week 9-10 |
| Gmail API limits | Exponential backoff, batch operations | Ongoing |

### Schedule Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Feature creep | Strict MVP scope, defer nice-to-haves |
| Integration issues | Continuous testing from Week 1 |
| Performance problems | Profile early and often |
| Hidden complexity | Buffer time in Weeks 11-12 |

## Success Metrics

### Week 12 Launch Criteria
- [ ] Can sync 10k+ emails reliably
- [ ] All core actions < 50ms response time
- [ ] Works offline for all operations
- [ ] Search returns results < 500ms
- [ ] Zero data loss in testing
- [ ] <0.1% error rate in beta

### Performance Targets
| Operation | Target | Max Acceptable |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Email list load | <100ms | 300ms |
| Email open | <50ms | 150ms |
| Search (local) | <10ms | 50ms |
| Archive action | <50ms | 200ms |
| Initial sync (1k emails) | <30s | 60s |

## Cost Projections

| Users | Monthly Cost | Per User |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| 100 | $30 | $0.30 |
| 1,000 | $200 | $0.20 |
| 10,000 | $1,500 | $0.15 |

## Key Decisions Log

1. **Single-device MVP**: Focus on stability over features
2. **PostgreSQL over SQLite**: Better for future scaling
3. **Defer AI**: Get core email right first
4. **2 weeks for sync**: Most critical component
5. **2 weeks for modifiers**: Reliability is paramount
6. **3-week production sprint**: Address only critical blockers (Jan 2025)
