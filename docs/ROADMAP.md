# Finito Mail Implementation Roadmap

This document provides a realistic roadmap for implementing Finito Mail's hybrid architecture. Based on expert review, we've adjusted timelines to ensure quality and stability.

## Architecture Summary

Finito Mail uses a **hybrid architecture** matching Inbox Zero's approach:
- **PostgreSQL** for email metadata (headers, subjects, senders)
- **Client-side IndexedDB** for email bodies and performance
- **Redis** for time-based features (snooze) and caching
- **Minimal server** for auth, webhooks, and API proxying

### Key Differentiators
1. **Modifier Queue Pattern** - Instant UI updates with background sync
2. **Progressive Sync** - Emails available in seconds, not minutes
3. **Hybrid Search** - Local results instantly, server results for completeness
4. **Push Notifications** - Real-time updates without polling

## MVP Definition

**12-Week Goal**: A rock-solid, performant, single-device email client with core productivity features.

**Explicitly Deferred**: Cross-device sync, AI features, and advanced optimizations (moved to post-MVP roadmap).

## Implementation Phases

### ðŸ“… Phase 1: Foundation & Sync (Weeks 1-5)

#### Weeks 1-2: Infrastructure & Gmail API + Security
```typescript
// Priority tasks
- [ ] Set up monorepo with Turborepo
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL schema for metadata

- [ ] Batch API operations (max 50/batch)
- [ ] Rate limiting with exponential backoff
- [ ] Field filtering for bandwidth optimization
```

**Key Deliverables:**

- [ ] Gmail watch request implementation
- [ ] **Data integrity validation (DataIntegrityValidator)**
- [ ] Cloudflare webhook handler
- [ ] WebSocket connection management
- [ ] Fallback polling strategy
- [ ] Server search proxy endpoint
- [ ] Search result merging (local + server)
- [ ] Search UI improvements
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Email changes appear within seconds
- Data consistency validated regularly
- Search returns complete results
- Graceful degradation if push fails

### ðŸ“… Phase 3: Stabilization & Launch (Weeks 11-12)

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Critical Code Patterns

**Always Use These Patterns:**

1. **Retry with Backoff:**
```typescript
await retryWithBackoff(async () => {
  return await gmail.users.messages.get({ 
    userId: 'me', 
    id: messageId 
  });
});
```

2. **Idempotent Operations:**
```typescript
interface ModifierOperation {
  id: string; // Unique UUID per operation
  type: 'archive' | 'delete' | 'snooze';
  emailId: string;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

3. **Sync Checkpoints:**
```typescript
interface SyncCheckpoint {
  userId: string;
  folderId: string;
  lastHistoryId: string;
  processedCount: number;
  totalCount: number;
  lastProcessedDate: Date;
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|-------|
| Sync complexity | 2 weeks allocated, checkpoint system | Week 3-4 |
| Modifier queue reliability | 2 weeks allocated, idempotency | Week 6-7 |
| Push notification setup | Fallback polling, 2 weeks allocated | Week 9-10 |
| Gmail API limits | Exponential backoff, batch operations | Ongoing |

### Schedule Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Feature creep | Strict MVP scope, defer nice-to-haves |
| Integration issues | Continuous testing from Week 1 |
| Performance problems | Profile early and often |
| Hidden complexity | Buffer time in Weeks 11-12 |

## Success Metrics

### Week 12 Launch Criteria
- [ ] Can sync 10k+ emails reliably
- [ ] All core actions < 50ms response time
- [ ] Works offline for all operations
- [ ] Search returns results < 500ms
- [ ] Zero data loss in testing
- [ ] <0.1% error rate in beta

### Performance Targets
| Operation | Target | Max Acceptable |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Email list load | <100ms | 300ms |
| Email open | <50ms | 150ms |
| Search (local) | <10ms | 50ms |
| Archive action | <50ms | 200ms |
| Initial sync (1k emails) | <30s | 60s |

## Cost Projections

| Users | Monthly Cost | Per User |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| 100 | $30 | $0.30 |
| 1,000 | $200 | $0.20 |
| 10,000 | $1,500 | $0.15 |

## Key Decisions Log

1. **Single-device MVP**: Focus on stability over features
2. **PostgreSQL over SQLite**: Better for future scaling
3. **Defer AI**: Get core email right first
4. **2 weeks for sync**: Most critical component
5. **2 weeks for modifiers**: Reliability is paramount

This roadmap prioritizes stability and core functionality. By deferring complex features like cross-device sync and AI to post-MVP, we increase the probability of launching a solid product on schedule.
