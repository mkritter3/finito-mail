## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks (Greatly Reduced)
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Browser storage limits | Proven 50GB+ available |
| Provider API limits | Direct access = higher quotas |
| Infrastructure costs | Already $0, can't go lower |
| Data loss | Provider is source of truth |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Low conversion | A/B test pricing, extend trial |
| High CAC | Focus on organic growth |
| Competition response | AI differentiation, faster innovation |
| Churn | Excellent onboarding, regular engagement |

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Principles
1. **Performance First**: Every feature must meet <100ms target
2. **Security by Design**: Encrypt everything, rotate tokens
3. **Cost Conscious**: Track per-user costs daily
4. **User Feedback**: Weekly interviews during beta
5. **Incremental Delivery**: Ship daily, feature flags for all

### Tech Debt Management
- Allocate 20% time for refactoring
- Document all shortcuts taken
- Plan refactoring sprints between phases
- Maintain test coverage > 80%

### Monitoring & Analytics
```
Key Metrics Dashboard:
├── Performance (p50, p95, p99)
├── User engagement (DAU, sessions)
├── Business (MRR, churn, CAC)
├── Technical (errors, uptime)
└── Cost per user
```
