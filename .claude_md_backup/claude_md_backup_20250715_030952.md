# 🤖 Claude CLI - Self-Learning Documentation System

**🚨 CRITICAL: Claude must ONLY read from `live_docs/` directory for current information.**

## 🧭 Live Documentation Navigation

**Claude: Read ONLY these verified, up-to-date files:**

### 📂 Current Working Documentation
- **[live_docs/CLAUDE.md](./live_docs/CLAUDE.md)** - Smart router and command reference
- **[live_docs/TOOLS_MCP.md](./live_docs/TOOLS_MCP.md)** - Verified MCP tool commands  
- **[live_docs/TOOLS_ELECTRON.md](./live_docs/TOOLS_ELECTRON.md)** - Verified Electron workflows
- **[live_docs/TOOLS_WEB.md](./live_docs/TOOLS_WEB.md)** - Verified web development tools
- **[live_docs/TOOLS_MOBILE.md](./live_docs/TOOLS_MOBILE.md)** - Verified mobile development tools

### 🧠 Persistent Learning
- **[CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md](./CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md)** - Your accumulated knowledge and experience

## 🔄 Self-Learning Process

### 1. Documentation Sources (Priority Order)
1. **live_docs/** - ONLY verified, working commands (read this)
2. **CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md** - Your persistent memory (always update)
3. **Context7** - Latest framework documentation (use for current info)
4. **Zen tools** - Multi-AI collaboration (use for strategy)

### 2. Memory Update Protocol
**Claude: ALWAYS update CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md when you:**
- ✅ Discover commands that work reliably
- ❌ Identify commands that fail or timeout
- 🔧 Find solutions to problems
- 📈 Learn better workflows
- 🐛 Solve debugging challenges

### 3. Repository Organization
**Current Structure:**
```
├── live_docs/          # ← READ ONLY FROM HERE (auto-generated)
├── CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md  # ← YOUR MEMORY (always update)
├── src_docs/           # Source documentation (human-edited)
├── archive/            # Old/deprecated files (ignore unless asked)
├── scripts/            # Verification and generation tools
└── .github/workflows/  # Auto-update CI/CD
```

## 🚨 Critical Rules for Claude

### ✅ ALWAYS DO:
1. **Read from `live_docs/` only** - This contains verified, working information
2. **Update `CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md`** - Add your learnings after every task
3. **Use Context7 first** - Get latest documentation before coding
4. **Use Zen tools** - Avoid direct MCP/Gemini commands that timeout
5. **Follow verification status** - Commands marked ✅ VERIFIED work reliably

### ❌ NEVER DO:
1. **Don't read from `archive/`** - Contains outdated, potentially confusing information
2. **Don't use `claude /mcp`** - Known to timeout and cause issues
3. **Don't use direct `gemini "command"`** - Use Zen chat instead
4. **Don't ignore verification status** - Commands marked ❌ FAILED will not work

## 🔧 Quick Command Reference

### Container Management (100% Reliable)
```bash
dev                    # Start development environment
dev --status          # Check status  
dev --rebuild          # Rebuild if needed
dev test-gui          # Test GUI forwarding
```

### Working Development Patterns
```bash
# Multi-AI collaboration (VERIFIED)
claude "Use zen chat with gemini-2.5-pro to analyze [problem]. use context7"

# Get documentation (VERIFIED) 
claude "Use context7 to get [framework] documentation focused on [topic]"

# Testing (VERIFIED)
e2e-test -u http://localhost:3000
autonomous-debug --url http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎯 Self-Optimization System

This documentation system:
- **Auto-verifies commands** before including them
- **Removes failing commands** from live documentation  
- **Archives outdated information** to prevent confusion
- **Updates based on real usage** and verification results
- **Maintains consistency** across all documentation files

## 🧠 Your Learning Cycle

1. **Read Task** → Check `live_docs/` for current methods
2. **Execute Work** → Use verified commands and workflows
3. **Learn from Results** → Note what worked/failed
4. **Update Memory** → Add findings to `CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md`
5. **Stay Current** → System auto-updates documentation based on verification

**Claude: This system ensures you always have accurate, working information and never get confused by outdated commands. Always read from `live_docs/` and update your knowledge after completing tasks.**
