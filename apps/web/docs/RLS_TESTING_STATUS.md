# RLS Testing Status

## Current Status: Local Development Focus

**Update**: We are focusing exclusively on local development. Staging deployment is deferred until core features are working locally.

## ‚úÖ Completed in Local Environment

### Infrastructure
1. **RLS Enabled** - All 14 tables have RLS policies active
2. **Authentication Setup** - @supabase/ssr properly configured
3. **Demo Users Created** - Alice, Bob, and Charlie available for testing
4. **Dev Auth Page** - Easy login at `/auth/dev`

### Scripts & Automation
1. **Schema Fix Script** - `fix:local-schema` creates public.users table
2. **RLS Migration** - Complete policies for all tables
3. **Verification Scripts** - Automated RLS testing available
4. **Demo Data Scripts** - Create users and sample data

## üöß Current Development Focus

### Vertical Slice 1: Inbox View (In Progress)
- [x] Enable RLS on database
- [x] Fix authentication flow
- [ ] Apply schema fix (public.users table)
- [ ] Create demo emails
- [ ] Get inbox displaying with RLS
- [ ] Implement email actions

### Next Slices (Planned)
1. **Email Rules** - Display and manage rules with RLS
2. **Single Email View** - View email details
3. **Gmail Integration** - OAuth and sync with RLS

## üìã Local Development Checklist

### One-Time Setup
- [ ] Run `npm run fix:local-schema`
- [ ] Apply SQL in Supabase Studio
- [ ] Run `npm run demo:create-users`
- [ ] Verify login works at `/auth/dev`

### For Each Feature
- [ ] Test with multiple users (Alice vs Bob)
- [ ] Verify no data leakage
- [ ] Check browser console for RLS errors
- [ ] Update tests if needed

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

```bash
# Setup
npm run fix:local-schema      # Generate schema fix
npm run demo:create-users     # Create demo users

# Verification
npm run rls:verify-enabled    # Check RLS status
npm run rls:phase2:verify     # Run comprehensive tests

# Development
npm run dev                   # Start dev server
```

## üìä Testing Approach

### Manual Testing
1. Sign in as different users
2. Verify data isolation
3. Test CRUD operations
4. Monitor for errors

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for components
- E2E tests with Playwright
- RLS verification scripts

## üö® Known Issues

1. **Foreign key constraints** - Need to apply schema fix first
2. **Empty inboxes** - Demo emails need to be created
3. **Schema mismatches** - Local may differ from staging/production

## üéØ Success Criteria for Local Development

- [ ] Users can sign in with demo accounts
- [ ] Each user sees only their own data
- [ ] No RLS policy violations in logs
- [ ] Core features work with RLS enabled
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## üìà Next Steps (After Local Development)

1. **Staging Testing** - Deploy and test with real-like data
2. **Performance Testing** - Verify RLS overhead is acceptable
3. **Security Audit** - Ensure no data leaks
4. **Production Deployment** - Gradual rollout with monitoring

**Current Focus**: Get the app working locally with RLS before moving to staging or production environments.
