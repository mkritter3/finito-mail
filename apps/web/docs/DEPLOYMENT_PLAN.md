# 🚀 Finito Mail Authentication Migration Deployment Plan

> **Last Updated**: 2025-01-28
> **Status**: Ready for Implementation
> **Timeline**: 7-10 business days to production beta

## 📋 Executive Summary

We have successfully completed the code migration from localStorage-based authentication to Supabase SSR cookie-based authentication. The application builds and lints successfully. However, **critical security implementation remains before any deployment**.

### Current State
- ✅ All authentication code migrated to cookie-based SSR
- ✅ Server/client component separation complete
- ✅ TypeScript build passing
- ✅ ESLint configured and passing
- 🚨 **BLOCKER**: Row Level Security (RLS) not implemented

### Timeline Overview
- **Days 1-4**: Security implementation & testing
- **Days 5-7**: Staging deployment & validation  
- **Days 8-10**: Internal beta testing
- **Week 2+**: Phased production rollout

## 🚨 Critical Security Requirements

### Row Level Security (RLS) - MUST COMPLETE BEFORE ANY DEPLOYMENT

Without RLS, our server-side Supabase client has privileged access that could expose all users' data. This is the #1 blocker.

#### Affected Tables
1. `emails` - Contains all user email data
2. `rules` - User-defined email rules
3. `gmail_credentials` - OAuth tokens and credentials
4. `email_sync_state` - Sync status and history IDs

#### Required RLS Policies

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE emails ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE rules ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE gmail_credentials ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE email_sync_state ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Emails table policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own emails"
  ON emails FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own emails"
  ON emails FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own emails"
  ON emails FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own emails"
  ON emails FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Rules table policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own rules"
  ON rules FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own rules"
  ON rules FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own rules"
  ON rules FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own rules"
  ON rules FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Gmail credentials policies (more restrictive)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own credentials"
  ON gmail_credentials FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own credentials"
  ON gmail_credentials FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own credentials"
  ON gmail_credentials FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Note: Consider if users should directly delete credentials
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own credentials"
  ON gmail_credentials FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Email sync state policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own sync state"
  ON email_sync_state FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own sync state"
  ON email_sync_state FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own sync state"
  ON email_sync_state FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own sync state"
  ON email_sync_state FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### RLS Testing Requirements

#### Automated Test Suite
Create integration tests that verify RLS enforcement:

```typescript
// Example RLS violation test
describe('RLS Security Tests', () => {
  it('should prevent user A from reading user B emails', async () => {
    // Authenticate as User A
    const userA = await authenticateUser('userA@example.com')
    
    // Attempt to read User B's emails
    const { error } = await supabase
      .from('emails')
      .select('*')
      .eq('user_id', 'userB-uuid')
    
    expect(error).toBeDefined()
    expect(error.code).toBe('42501') // PostgreSQL insufficient privilege
  })
  
  it('should prevent INSERT with spoofed user_id', async () => {
    // Authenticate as User A
    const userA = await authenticateUser('userA@example.com')
    
    // Attempt to insert email for User B
    const { error } = await supabase
      .from('emails')
      .insert({
        user_id: 'userB-uuid', // Attempting to spoof
        subject: 'Malicious email',
        // ... other fields
      })
    
    expect(error).toBeDefined()
    expect(error.message).toContain('row-level security')
  })
})
```

## 📝 Comprehensive Testing Checklist

### Phase 1: Authentication Flow Tests

#### Basic Auth Flow
- [ ] Fresh login with Google OAuth
  - [ ] Verify redirect to /mail after success
  - [ ] Verify session cookie is set
  - [ ] Verify user data is accessible
- [ ] Logout functionality
  - [ ] Verify cookie is cleared
  - [ ] Verify redirect to /auth
  - [ ] Verify protected routes redirect when logged out
- [ ] Remember me / session persistence
  - [ ] Close browser, reopen, verify still logged in

#### Session Management Edge Cases
- [ ] **Session Expiry - Manual Test**
  1. Log in successfully
  2. Open browser DevTools > Application > Cookies
  3. Delete the `sb-auth-token` cookie
  4. Attempt to navigate to a new page
  5. **Expected**: Redirect to /auth with message "Session expired"
  
- [ ] **Session Expiry During Server Action**
  1. Log in and navigate to /mail
  2. Delete auth cookie via DevTools
  3. Click "Archive" on an email
  4. **Expected**: Toast notification "Session expired, please log in again"
  5. **Expected**: Redirect to /auth after 2 seconds
  
- [ ] **Multi-Tab Session Sync**
  1. Open app in Tab A, log in
  2. Open app in Tab B, verify logged in
  3. Log out in Tab B
  4. Switch to Tab A, perform any action
  5. **Expected**: Tab A recognizes logout and redirects

#### CSRF Protection Verification
- [ ] Verify all Server Actions use POST method only
- [ ] Test Server Action with manipulated Origin header (should fail)
- [ ] Verify cookies have SameSite attribute set

### Phase 2: Security & RLS Tests

#### RLS Enforcement Tests
- [ ] **Cross-User Data Access Prevention**
  - [ ] Create two test accounts
  - [ ] Verify User A cannot see User B's emails via API
  - [ ] Verify User A cannot modify User B's rules
  - [ ] Verify User A cannot access User B's credentials

- [ ] **Data Manipulation Prevention**
  - [ ] Test INSERT with spoofed user_id (must fail)
  - [ ] Test UPDATE attempting to change user_id (must fail)
  - [ ] Test bulk operations respect user boundaries

- [ ] **Real-time Subscription Isolation**
  - [ ] User A and User B both subscribed to email updates
  - [ ] User A marks email as read
  - [ ] Verify only User A receives the real-time update

### Phase 3: Core Functionality Regression

#### Email Operations
- [ ] Email list loads correctly
  - [ ] Pagination works
  - [ ] Sorting works
  - [ ] Folder navigation works
- [ ] Email viewing
  - [ ] HTML content renders
  - [ ] Attachments accessible
  - [ ] Thread view works
- [ ] Bulk actions
  - [ ] Mark read/unread (test with 10, 50, 100 emails)
  - [ ] Archive emails
  - [ ] Delete emails
  - [ ] Apply labels

#### Gmail Sync
- [ ] Initial sync after auth
- [ ] Incremental sync via webhook
- [ ] Manual sync trigger
- [ ] Watch renewal cron job

#### Rules Engine
- [ ] Create new rule
- [ ] Edit existing rule
- [ ] Delete rule
- [ ] Rule execution on new emails
- [ ] Drag-and-drop reordering

### Phase 4: Performance & Scale Tests

#### Load Tests
- [ ] **Bulk Operation Performance**
  - [ ] Select 500 emails
  - [ ] Perform bulk archive
  - [ ] **Must complete within 10 seconds** (Vercel limit)
  - [ ] If fails, implement background job pattern

- [ ] **Large Email List**
  - [ ] Load inbox with 1000+ emails
  - [ ] Verify pagination performance
  - [ ] Test search/filter performance

#### Concurrent User Tests
- [ ] Multiple tabs performing operations
- [ ] SSE connection limit handling
- [ ] Database connection pooling

### Phase 5: Error Handling & Recovery

#### Network Failures
- [ ] Offline mode detection
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed requests

#### API Errors
- [ ] 4xx errors show user-friendly messages
- [ ] 5xx errors have fallback UI
- [ ] Rate limiting handled gracefully
